Drug resistance is the problem in which a drug fails to show its effect to its full potential and the outcome of the therapy becomes nil that is when cancer cells or microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, don’t respond to a drug that is usually able to kill or weaken them. In cancer treatment, there are many things that may cause resistance to anticancer drugs. For example, DNA changes or other genetic changes may change the way the drug gets into the cancer cells or the way the drug is broken down within the cancer cells. Drug resistance can lead to cancer treatment not working or to the cancer coming back(National Cancer Institute). Drug resistance is an old but constantly evolving problem in the treatment of infectious diseases and malignant cancers. The cancer cell resistance against the anticancer agents can be due to many factors such as the individual’s genetic differences, especially in tumoral somatic cells (science direct)

Cancer cells will become resistant to drugs by the mechanisms such as the inactivation of the drug, multi-drug resistance, cell death inhibition (apoptosis suppression), altering in the drug metabolism, epigenetic changing, changes in the drug targets, enhances DNA-repair and target gene amplification.

One of the primary mechanisms is the acquisition of genetic mutations that alter the drug's target, rendering it less effective. For example, mutations in the BCR-ABL gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) can lead to resistance against tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib. This mutation prevents the drug from binding effectively to its target, allowing cancer cells to continue proliferating.

Drug resistance significantly impacts the treatment of cancer by limiting the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies. In many cases, patients initially respond well to treatment, but over time, the cancer cells evolve and develop resistance, leading to relapse. This phenomenon is particularly common in cancers like lung, breast, and ovarian cancer, where resistance to therapies such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and targeted agents like EGFR inhibitors has been widely documented.

In conclusion, drug resistance remains a critical challenge in the treatment of cancer.As cancer cells evolve and develop mechanisms to evade the effects of treatment, it becomes increasingly vital to understand these processes and design strategies to overcome them. By advancing our knowledge of drug resistance and developing novel therapeutic approaches, we can improve treatment efficacy and enhance patient outcomes.
